Dear Team Members,

The attached PCAT spreadsheet is my updated cost-to-complete the 
DSS-28 implementation. The DSS-28_sched_PDRCDR.xls is an updated, 
high level schedule consistent with the time-phasing in the cost 
sheet and our goal to complete the implementation by December 2007 
(11 months after the review) and devote FY08 to integration and test. 
We deliver to LCER for operations and ITT for maintenance October 
2008. I am starting to work now on a more detailed integrated 
schedule. I also will update the color-of-money chart once the team 
vets the cost estimate.

The cost approximately holds together. I will explain how at 
tomorrow's meeting. We succeeded with our DSS-28 lien for $69.3K, 
which captured the FY07 under-run and also restored the artificial 
cuts to NASA/IND's funding due to overhead rate changes. We will have 
to change the profile a bit, spending more in FY07, spending less in 
FY08 and squeezing a little in JPL engineering support during final 
I&T. DSMS indicated during the lien decision a willingness to change 
the profile, but not to augment the funding.

I intend to send individual emails to all of you tomorrow stating the 
assumptions I made in arriving at the cost-to-complete, or the 
mapping from the cost material you provided me into the rolled-up 
cost sheet. Alternatively, we can sit behind my computer and 
walk-through it.

No surprise, the strain in the budget is providing all the JPL 
engineering support on such a tight budget.

See you tomorrow at the meeting, regards,

Larry
