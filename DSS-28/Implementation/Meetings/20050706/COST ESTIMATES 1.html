Dear Leadership, System Engineering, and Science Team members,
<P>
The next critical initial package arrived, antenna mechanical. The 
main subsystems that distinguish between the beam-waveguide focus and 
prime focus options are antenna mechanical and microwave. From these 
(plus the original estimate that Art Freiley received from Paula 
Brown for microwave in Dec 2003 which did NOT include downconversion 
and assumed only total power detection at RF) we see:
<PRE>
			BWG Focus	Prime focus
			---------	-----------
Antenna Mechanical	   771		    883
Microwave		  1680		   1490
			---------	-----------
			 $2451K		  $2373
</PRE>
So the prime focus option is marginally better financially as it 
stands, includes downconversion (which has not been costed yet for 
the BWG focus option), includes some backend capability (digital 
spectrometer) and is clearly much more capable.
<P>
Other approximate costs I have in hand:
	- from Scott Morgan, $400K for APC antenna controller
	- from Thang Trinh's old EAC estimate $300K, M&C
<P>
Total cost of the above ~ $2.4 + $400 + 300 = $3.1M, but ... we have 
not costed task management, system engineering, reserve/contingency, 
radiometer, integration and test, networking and signal distribution 
to DSS-13 and beyond. Nor have we addressed the "implicit" cost 
carried in the ITT contract for GDSCC field support - not a cost that 
the DSS-28 implementation will bear but a cost that IND/DSMS will be 
sensitive to through the ITT contract.
<P>
So it appears that we can bring this in within the $3.2M cap but I 
anticipate pushing back on the initial subsystem costs to carve out 
headroom for the yet-to-be-costed items above.
<P>
Regards,
<P>
Larry

&gt;Larry,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Attached is the .xls file of the ANTMECH/Controller cost estimates <BR>
&gt;for the initial package, as compiled by Neil Bucknam.  Here's a <BR>
&gt;summary:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1.  Pedestal Feed :        $771.2K<BR>
&gt;2.  Prime-Focus Feed:  $833.2K<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;We understand that you now have an updated number from Scott Morgan <BR>
&gt;on the Antenna Controller costs.  Also, please note that this <BR>
&gt;estimate assumes buying 4 new azimuth wheels, bearings and axles, <BR>
&gt;etc, for $100K.  Another high ticket item here is $100K for spares.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;At the last meeting, you wanted to know if you could commit the $$ <BR>
&gt;for the azimuth wheels this FY.  Yes, with minor drawing <BR>
&gt;modifications, we could initiate the procurement and get it spent <BR>
&gt;this FY.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Regards,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
